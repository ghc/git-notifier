0.2 | 2011-01-07 10:06:31 -0800

  * The script now waits a little bit after sending out each mail.
    Before, mails sent back-to-back could arrive with identical
    timestamps, making it harder to determine their actual order.

0.1-5 | 2011-01-02 10:18:10 -0800

  * Updating update-changes. (Robin Sommer)

  * Now mails are also sent when a head updates to now include further
    commits that have already been reported earlier (e.g., on
    fast-forwards). These mails summarize all revisions on the path from
    its previous state to the new head position. This is experimental at
    this point. (Robin Sommer)

  * The script now checks for "-h" or "--help" as a command-line
    option, and prints a short (and not very helpful) usage message
    if found. (Robin Sommer)

0.1-3 | 2011-01-01 21:44:11 -0800 | 94154e05ff29522e256803d2cfe9b7d98d28b138

  * Renaming the "recipients" options to "mailinglist", as it was
    already documented. (Matthias Vallentin)

0.1-2 | 2011-01-01 21:41:09 -0800 | b650d20a8d10c9bc8de20c3715c9b1dab9100288

  * Adding "[nomail]" option: if that tag is included in a commit
    message, no mail will be send for that change. Also, documenting the
    already existing "[nodiff]" option: if included in a commit message,
    no diff will be included for that change. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding update-changes script. (Robin Sommer)
